# TODO
- Build Targets
    - Win32 (if it doesn't work by default)
    - Mac
    - Linux
    - iOS/Android?
- Test with LÖVE 11.4 (and older versions, too.)
- Handle other naming conventions using format strings.
- `-x` to exclude input files from being added to the build
- some flag to exclude specific Löve dlls (like `nuklear.dll`)
